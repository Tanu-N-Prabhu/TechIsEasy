# About
I **Tanu Nanda Prabhu**, always like to simplify complex things so that others can understand them more easily and better. Researching is my passion, I go through a ton of videos, articles, and tutorials and conclude starting a repository that purely contains tips and tricks for using Google Sheets. I update this repository every week with tons of information that will make your life simple. I am also seeking help from people who want to contribute to my repository. Feel free to Fork it and add updates, I will consider it. Feel free to let me know any changes, comments, concerns, and suggestions [here](tanunprabhu95@gmail.com)
