# Steps

1. Use the `split` built-in function. Click on a new cell and type `=SPLIT(text, " ,-=")`. The split function has a delimiter parameter which is nothing but all the characters that are used to separate the text such as `, -/=`.
2. On clicking the `Enter` key you will see that the text is split in two separate columns.
3. Drag the text till the end of the table to see the same with all the other data.
