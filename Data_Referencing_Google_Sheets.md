## Is Data Referencing Possible?
Yes, data may be replicated and copied from one sheet to another inside a single spreadsheet.

## What is data referencing?
Using data from one source in this case a sheet to another sheet for multiple reasons. You can also say Reference data is the data used to define and classify other data.

## You can achieve this in 3 simple steps

1. Obviously you need to open the corresponding Google sheet where you have the data.
2. Select the specific cell that you want to use on the other sheet.
3. Follor the syntax for referencing. Append `"="` along with the sheet name, an exclamation point. For example, `=GoogleSheet1!A1` or `='Google Sheet number two'!B4.`

```
If your sheet name has spaces or other non-alphanumeric symbols, include single quotes around it (as in the second example)

```
