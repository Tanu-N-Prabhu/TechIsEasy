## 3 steps to create a dropdown menu
1. Right-Click on a cell and scroll down to choose `Dropdown` on the menu.
2. You can add as much as items as you want by choosing the `Add Another Item` option.
3. To distinguish you can color code them as well.

By clicking on the `Advanced Option`, you can change the display style of the dropdown to `Chip`, `Arrow`, and `Plain Text`. After adding the data, don't forget to click on `Done` to update the data on your Google Sheet.
